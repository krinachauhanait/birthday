      <p>
        From BMA to College, those 4 years were not enough, but it was worth it and wishes for such more years of madness!
        I never even thought that you will be the one to whom I'll share all my secrets, useless talks and gossips about our classmates &#128514;
      </p>
      <p>
        I can remember each and every funny moment wwe spent together at our tution, not a single one is forgettable.
      </p>
      <p>
        From crazy selfies to endless talks, every moment with you is priceless.  
        You are my comfort zone buddy🫂. No matter what, I'm always wih you and never hesitate to tell me anything about me that is annoying to you!
      </p>
      <p> I'll do it more and more times &#128514; </p>
      <p class="highlight">
        Wishing you lots of love, money, good health and a fine handsome life-partner &#128527;🎂🎉
        <br>
